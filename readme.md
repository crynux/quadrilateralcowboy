# Quadrilateral Cowboy

## Note about this fork
I created this fork for building on FreeBSD. There are 2 scripts to help with that.
1. freebsd_install_deps.csh - can be used to install dependencies for building.
2. freebsd_build.csh - can be used to build on FreeBSD.

If you find any issues running this on FreeBSD, please feel free to either create an issue or a PR; thanks!
